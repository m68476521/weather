# Kotlin Multiplatform Project

This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** project powered by **Compose Multiplatform**. It allows you to share code seamlessly across **Android, iOS, and Desktop**, reducing development time while maintaining high performance and native feel.

---

## 🏗 Project Architecture

The project is organized into modular directories to separate shared logic from platform-specific entry points.

### 📁 `/composeApp`
This module contains the core of your application. It houses the UI and business logic that is shared across all platforms.

* **`commonMain`**: The most important folder. This contains code that runs on **all** targets. It includes shared Compose UI, navigation, business logic, and data models.
* **`androidMain`**: Contains Android-specific code, such as the `MainActivity`, Android Manifest, and any library integrations that require the Android SDK.
* **`iosMain`**: This is where you implement iOS-specific functionality. For example, if you need to call Apple’s **CoreCrypto**, **CoreLocation**, or **StoreKit** APIs, you place those calls here.
* **`desktopMain`**: Contains code for the Desktop (JVM) target, including window configurations and desktop-specific resource handling.

### 📁 `/iosApp`
Even though the UI is shared via Compose Multiplatform, every iOS app requires a native entry point to boot on Apple devices.
* **Entry Point**: Contains the Xcode project and the SwiftUI code that hosts the shared Compose view.
* **Native UI**: This is the place to add any native **SwiftUI** views if your project requires a hybrid approach.
